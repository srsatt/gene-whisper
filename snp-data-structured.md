### Description of the `snp-data-structured.json` File

This JSON file contains a comprehensive dataset of genetic information curated from SNPedia. The data is organized into a single top-level object with four main keys: `snps`, `medicines`, `topics`, and `conditions`.

#### Top-Level Structure

*   `snps`: An object where each key is a unique SNP identifier (e.g., "rs12345" or "i5000001"). The value is a detailed `Snp` object.
*   `medicines`: An array of strings, where each string is the name of a medicine (e.g., "Aspirin", "Ibuprofen").
*   `topics`: An array of strings, where each string is a general topic (e.g., "Eye color", "Longevity").
*   `conditions`: An array of strings, where each string is the name of a medical condition (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes", "Alzheimer's disease").

#### The `Snp` Object Structure

Each SNP object within the `snps` map contains the following fields:

*   `title` (optional, string): The primary name or title of the SNP, usually its identifier.
*   `genotypes` (array of `Genotype` objects): A list of all known genotypes for this SNP.
*   `tags` (object): Contains arrays of tags derived from links within the SNP's descriptive text.
    *   `medicines`: An array of medicine names relevant to this SNP.
    *   `topics`: An array of topic names relevant to this SNP.
    *   `conditions`: An array of medical condition names relevant to this SNP.
*   `categories` (optional, array of strings): A list of categories the SNP belongs to on SNPedia.
*   `sections` (optional, array of `Section` objects): The main content of the SNPedia page, broken down into sections. Each section can contain paragraphs, lists, tables, and templates with detailed information like chromosome, position, gene, etc.

#### The `Genotype` Object Structure

Each `Genotype` object within the `genotypes` array of a `Snp` contains the following fields:

*   `name` (string): The full name of the genotype (e.g., "rs12345(A;G)").
*   `title` (optional, string): The title of the genotype page.
*   `tags` (object): Similar to the SNP's `tags` object, this contains tags specific to the genotype.
    *   `medicines`: An array of relevant medicine names.
    *   `topics`: An array of relevant topic names.
    *   `conditions`: An array of relevant medical condition names.
*   `categories` (array of strings): Categories the genotype belongs to.
*   `sections` (array of `Section` objects): The main content from the genotype's SNPedia page. This is where the most critical information is found.

#### The `Section` and `Template` Objects (Key Details)

The `sections` array is the most important part of both `Snp` and `Genotype` objects. It holds the parsed wikitext from SNPedia. Within each section, there is a `templates` array that contains structured data.

For a `Genotype`, the most important template is the one where `"template": "genotype"`. This template object contains key fields like:

*   `magnitude` (string): A number from 0 to 10 indicating the significance of the genotype. This is a crucial field.
*   `repute` (string): A qualitative assessment (e.g., "Good", "Bad").
*   `summary` (string): a brief, human-readable summary of the genotype's effect.
*   `allele1` and `allele2` (string): The two alleles that make up the genotype.

For a `Snp`, the templates can contain a wide variety of information, such as:

*   `gene`, `chromosome`, `position`: The genetic location of the SNP.
*   `gmaf`: Global Minor Allele Frequency.
*   `orientation`: The orientation of the alleles on the DNA strand.

#### Summary for an LLM

In essence, you have a primary dictionary of SNPs. For each SNP, you have its own data and a list of all its possible genotypes. Both SNPs and genotypes are tagged with relevant medicines, topics, and medical conditions. The most detailed information, especially the clinical significance (`magnitude`, `repute`, `summary`), is found within the `templates` array inside the `sections` of each `Genotype` object. This structure allows for complex queries, such as finding all SNPs related to a specific condition and then examining the effects of each of their genotypes.
